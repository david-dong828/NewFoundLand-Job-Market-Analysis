# NewFoundLand-Job-Market-Analysis

Well, the purpose of doing such an analysis is just to satisfy my curiosity: How tough is the Job market to CS students? ðŸ˜®

ðŸ˜Ž Eventually, after spending my weekend, I got this analysis.

ðŸ˜Ž Let's take a look at the result firstly, and then I will tell you how to get it.

> **Interpretation**

**1. The Job word cloud: the bigger the word, the more job demands.**
   
   * Well, disappointingly, it showed a stark absence of CS-related roles.
   * Look, the only thing we saw at a glance was postions like assistant or whaever..

**2. The Job density map: The more desity, the more jobs.**

  * I was supprised to find Two Job centers: St.John's and Labrador. I thought there would be only St.John's.
  * Also, nearby areas of St.John's like Mount Pearl and Paradise also showed significant opportunities.

**3. HDBScan: These clusters illustrated the geographic spread of job opportunities**

  * It highlighted the concentration of jobs in St. Johnâ€™s, marked by vibrant red and orange dots on the map. 
  * black dots, might representing outliers, indicated unique jobs in more remote locations.

**4. LDA for job requirement analysis: to understand the nature of these jobs**

  * For topic 1, it seems to revolve around positions that require a degree of responsibility and coordination, likely in an administrative or managerial capacity ðŸ˜Ž . 
  * The presence of words like "assistant," "program," "manager," and "officer" suggests roles that may involve oversight, planning, and execution of various programs or projects.
  * The terms "health" and "safety" indicate a possible focus on roles related to health and safety management, while "training" and "services" might imply roles in the service industry or corporate training domains. 
  * "Valid license" suggests jobs that require certification or specific qualifications.
